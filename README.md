# My Articles


Context
The Readly app has various kinds of content on offer. The magazine is most popular among them, but the app also recommends individual articles that it thinks the user will find interesting. These articles are opened in a custom reader view with various features to make the reading experience more pleasant and immersive.

The task
We want to add a new app feature that lets users bookmark an article to easily come back to it later. The user should be able to see a list of all the articles that they have bookmarked and open any of them. The bookmarked articles should be kept on the device and survive the app being restarted but do not have to be synced to other devices or survive the app being re-installed.
